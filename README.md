# MsCoreSys Workshop - Multi-Omic data analysis

*Topics*: data handling, pre-processing, integration using MOFA, troubleshooting, results interpretation

*Duration*: 1.5h

## Outline
Today we will get familiar with the MOFA method and work with bulk multi-omics data such as a data set on leukemia samples covering RNA-seq, methylation, drug response and genomic data. Here, participants will learn how to prepare and normalize the data for an integrative analysis and what data containers can be useful (e.g., MultiAssayExperiment). Once set up, the practical will show how to call the method on the data, make use of basic options and address any issues that can arise. Individually or in small groups, the participants will then discover different ways to interpret the results and perform different kinds of down-stream analyses, such as enrichment analysis, clustering, outlier detection.

If you finish the CLL example early, you are encouraged to try using MOFA2 to integrate another multi-omic dataset, which can be found in the "Optional" folder.
